# Tech Well

Tech Well is a challenging custom map for Animal Well fans. This map focuses on a lot of unused mechanics and glitches to create interesting platforming challenges.

Tech Well includes 5 Normal Challenges and a Final Challenge. The Final Challenge can only be accessed with a secret flute code. You’ll need to decipher this code by completing all 5 Normal Challenges and paying close attention to detail.

Each of the 5 Normal Challenges teaches you about obscure tech related to a specific item. This means you'll only need one item to complete each challenge.

To prevent carrying items between challenges, the map will softlock the player. This restriction is necessary until a workaround is found for caching player inventory.

## Important

*If you want to leave a challenge, you’ll need to reset your save file.*
*Don’t worry though—resetting your save file won’t affect your progress, as none of the items in the challenges are required to complete the map.*
